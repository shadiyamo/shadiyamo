Welcome to My GitHub! 🌸🌻

Hi there! 👋🏼 I’m Shadiya, a Software Developer & AI Enthusiast 💻✨ with a passion for Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science. I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence in the Biosciences at Queen Mary University of London 🌷, where I’m diving into software development, predictive modeling, and creating AI-driven solutions. 💡

What I'm Working On:
Software Development – Building scalable and efficient applications 💻
Machine Learning & AI – Exploring active learning techniques and handling datasets with missing data 📊
Data Science – Developing models for predictive analytics and optimisation 📈

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me immersed in a good book📚 or training for the London Marathon🏃‍♀️ — because endurance applies to both reading and debugging! 

Let’s connect and collaborate! 💫🌟
